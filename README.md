### Team Data Knights: Checkmate!
# Project I - Who plays chess?

## Background

Whether financial, political, or social -- data's true power lies in its ability to answer questions definitively. In this group project, we've utilized Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer a question: "Who plays chess?"

## Motivation and Summary

* Initially we wanted to see if The Queen's Gambit release on Netflix had an influence on the popularity of chess.
* Reevaluated available data sources and settled on the question: Who plays chess on chess.com?
* Determined this by asking:

    a. Where is it the most popular and who has the most users (by country)?
    
    b. Of those users, which country has the highest percent of premium accounts?
    
    c. What country has the most titled users?
    
    d. Of the titled users, which are most popular?
    
    e. Compare the amount of users who joined in 2019 vs. 2020

Able to answer? Yes!
