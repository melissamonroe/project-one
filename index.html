<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>Whether financial, political, or social – data’s true power lies in its ability to answer questions definitively. In this group project, we’ve utilized Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer a question: “Who plays chess?”</p>

<h2 id="motivation-and-summary">Motivation and Summary</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Initially we wanted to see if The Queen’s Gambit release on Netflix had an influence on the popularity of chess.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Reevaluated available data sources and settled on the question: Who plays chess on chess.com?</p>
  </li>
  <li>Determined this by asking:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Where is it the most popular and who has the most users (by country)?</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Of those users, which country has the highest percent of premium accounts?</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>What country has the most titled users?</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Of the titled users, which are most popular?</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Compare the amount of users who joined in 2019 vs. 2020</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
