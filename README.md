### Team Data Knights: Checkmate!
# Project I - Who plays chess?

## Background

Whether financial, political, or social -- data's true power lies in its ability to answer questions definitively. In this group project, we've utilized Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer a question: "Who plays chess?"

## Motivation and Summary

* Initially we wanted to see if The Queen's Gambit release on Netflix had an influence on the popularity of chess.

* Reevaluated available data sources and settled on the question: Who plays chess on chess.com?

* Determined this by asking:
    - Where is it the most popular and who has the most users (by country)?
    
    - Of those users, which country has the highest percent of premium accounts?
    
    - What country has the most titled users?
    
    - Of the titled users, which are most popular?
    
    - Compare the amount of users who joined in 2019 vs. 2020

* Able to answer? Yes! 

## Questions & Data

* Of the recently joined users and online users on chesss.com, where is it the most popular? most users? (by country)

* Of these users, which country has the highest percent of premium accounts ($99/year)?

* What country has the most titled users?

* Of the titled users, who are the most popular for each title? (top 10 w/ the most followers) 

* Top 10 countries with the most active and joined users in 2019 and 2020?

    
Data Needed:
* Players data that includes their country of origin, joined date, account status, account type and their title.

* Found data on the chess.com api. 


## Data Cleanup & Exploration

### ChessPy
* Imported our dependencies and set our file paths 
resources : country codes from website matching ISO country code and mapping country name

* Used the chess.com api for players by country and created a function to get a list of current/recently added player names from each country and exported to to csv 
Created a function to call on the same api to get get a list of all player details (in all countries) that are titled players and exported to csv 

* Once we had a list of all the usernames, we chose the top 10 countries.
Created a function to create a sample of usernames from each of our chosen countries for 15% of usernames if under 5000, or 5000 for countries over. 

* Once we had the sample size, we pulled the player data for each player in the sample per country, created a df and exported to csvâ€™s

### Chess Details 

* Imported dependencies and set our files paths to read in (each of the player details csv)

* Country player count 

* Defined function to get the player joined dates, and put the date in month/year format  for top 10 countries 
Grouped the joined year/month data frames and performed a count on each to see how many 

* Converted datetime from epoch time to regular date format 
Narrowed down the data to find the joined data for 2019/2020
Create data-frames for each country to show the joined date, then plotted the join dates of the top 10 countries in a line plot .
